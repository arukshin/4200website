        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This dataset compiles a list of asteroids that NASA has identified as 
            Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), highlighting those that are closest to our planet and could 
            potentially cause harm. In outer space, there are an infinite amount of objects, some of 
            which are much closer to Earth than most people imagine. For example, even a distance as 
            seemingly large as an asteroid being 70,000 kilometers is quite small when the astronomical 
            scale is taken into account. As a result, harmful asteroids at this distance can 
            pose a threat and disrupt many natural phenomena. This dataset allows viewers to gain 
            insight into the proximity and characteristics of NEOs, increasing awareness of potential 
            harmful objects. </p>

         <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.288.5474.2190">NEO Basics</a>, 
         which provides information on the basics of near Earth objects. Read the following
         <a href="https://www.livescience.com/what-are-potentially-hazardous-asteroids">paper</a> 
        to understand the dangers of hazardous Near Earth Objects.</p>

    <h3>Our Data and Preprocessing</h3>

    <p> This dataset contains descriptive information regarding objects in space near Earth. The CSV file 
        contains 10 columns and 90,614 rows of data to work with. It contains important information for 
        each asteroid that was monitored such as its name, approximate minimum size, approximate maximum 
        size, distance it missed Earth by, relative velocity, magnitude, and if it was presumed dangerous 
        or not. This dataset contains both categorical and numerical forms of data to work with and contains 
        a minimal amount of missing data. This <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameepvani/nasa-nearest-earth-objects">dataset</a> 
        was acquired from Kaggle. They pulled this data from the NASA Open API as well as NEO Earth Close Approaches. This dataset provides necessary information to 
        perform an analysis on the potential dangers of objects near Earth. However, it only contains data 
        regarding Earth so we cannot make any comparisons to other planets as well with this dataset. </p>
        
    <p>To preprocess the data, we cut the size down to 2000 rows, as this makes visuallzing the features of the 
        data much simpler. In addition, we created a 'year' column by extracting the year from the 'name' column.
        after this process was complete, we ultimately decided to drop the 'name' column as the name only contians the NEO ID and
        year of the NEO, both of which already exist as columns in our dataframe. After preprocessing was complete,
        our data included the following features:  </p>

              <p> This figure visualizes the years with the highest and lowest average miss distances relative to Earth. 
               The year 1960 has the highest average miss distance, suggesting that during this year, the NEOs passing by the Earth were generally further away than in other years. 
              Conversely, 1950 had the lowest average miss distance, indicating that NEOs were, on average, significantly closer to Earth during this period.
              However, most years have a similar average miss distance, especially from 2004-2022. This can be used as a baseline in order to predict miss distance for future years, since the general trend of miss distances may remain stable over time.

        <h3>Conclusion and Future Directions</h3>

        <p>
            Overall, our analysis provides valuable insights into the trends and characteristics of Near Earth Objects
            From a visual standpoint, hazardous NEOs tend to have a higher velocity relative to non-hazardous objects. 
            While our remaining visualizations show some patterns related to hazardous objects, it is unclear if these 
            patterns are significant or not.

        </p>
        <p>
            To better understand how our features work together, we would like to 
            incorporate a predictive model to see if features of hazardous objects are
            distinguishable from features of non-hazardous objects.
